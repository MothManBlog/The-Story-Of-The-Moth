Moth Man Blog Day 1

8/9/24 

Before you start reading, I must pose an open question to the readers of my new blog: if you lost everything you had (girlfriend, friends, people's trust, etc.) do you think there is any point in rebuilding?

To elaborate, I should take you to where the heartbreak began.

Ft Rucker. A small military community where a 12 year old just gathered his courage to ask out his long time friend, let's call her Alanna. She tried to let him down nicely.

But he was a hard-headed boy...

If it wasn't already clear, I am that boy (this is my blog after all).

And this became a defining moment in my life, because instead of saying no, after I pressed for an answer (which was a mean move), she ran from me. This hurt me. Badly. And yet to this day she still is my biggest supporter, Alanna if I ever show you this. Thank you! You changed me for the better

FAST FOWARD TO TODAY

I quit my job at Dairy Queen. Everything about it sucked. Pay, conditions, you name it. They were bad at it.

the last straw was them REFUSING to pay me overtime. And then trying to make me work anyway.

So I quit...

In tears, I text the one person I have left... Alanna and she calls almost immediately.

The details are not noteworthy. Just her telling me to calm down. 

The reason I spoke to someone who lives hundreds of miles from me?

She anchors me in reality.

That's enough for today

I will have more by tomorrow!

Thanks Alanna
